<h2>8 bits on Hacker News</h2>

<article>
    <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> is feed of news across the technology spectrum. On a day-to-day basis, you see the same type of information pop up. I am going to go through a few of those.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>New Technology</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Usually you see a new platform or service posted. 90% of the time, they are worthy of notice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>You&#39;re Doing it Wrong</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Every few days you&#39;ll see there was a blog article posted. It will be a highly opinionated article about how someone or a company is doing it wrong. Which can definitely add perspective to a common belief.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>New Releases</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If something new and amazing comes out for an existing popular product, you&#39;ll usually see it on Hacker News. Whether that be good or bad.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Acquisitions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When a major tech company has acquired another company. You&#39;ll see it within an hour or two on HN.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>A Realization</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These usually contain a lengthy post about how someone just is not happy anymore or they are working to improve their life or business. I personally enjoy these articles the most.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>ASK HN</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These are the common &quot;ASK HN:&quot; discussions. Usually about jobs and personal concerns that someone would like to discuss.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Startups</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These articles are focused on successful and unsuccessful startups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>DIY Projects</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>These projects are things like hacking your coffee maker, robots, or your garage door opener. These are always fun to read and try.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
