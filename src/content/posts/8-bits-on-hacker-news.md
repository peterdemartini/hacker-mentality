[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is feed of news across the technology spectrum. On a day-to-day basis, you see the same type of information pop up. I am going to go through a few of those.

1. **New Technology**
	- Usually you see a new platform or service posted. 90% of the time, they are worthy of notice.

2. **You're Doing it Wrong**
	- Every few days you'll see there was a blog article posted. It will be a highly opinionated article about how someone or a company is doing it wrong. Which can definitely add perspective to a common belief.

3. **New Releases**
	- If something new and amazing comes out for an existing popular product, you'll usually see it on Hacker News. Whether that be good or bad.

4. **Acquisitions**
	- When a major tech company has acquired another company. You'll see it within an hour or two on HN.

5. **A Realization**
	- These usually contain a lengthy post about how someone just is not happy anymore or they are working to improve their life or business. I personally enjoy these articles the most.

6. **ASK HN**
	- These are the common "ASK HN:" discussions. Usually about jobs and personal concerns that someone would like to discuss.

7. **Startups**
	- These articles are focused on successful and unsuccessful startups.

8. **DIY Projects**
	- These projects are things like hacking your coffee maker, robots, or your garage door opener. These are always fun to read and try.
